## Introduction
A consistent design system is integrated to the all of the app types by using `styled-components` and `theme.js` file generated by [Theme Manager](http://theme-manager.com). 

`styled-component` is one of the most common ways to style components in the react ecosystem. It allows users to write styles in css within the js files. 

[Theme Manager](http://theme-manager.com) allows users to curate design tokens such as colors, space, border-radius, etc and then export them in a json object which then can be consumed within our apps.

`styled-components` provides `<ThemeProvider>` component which accepts a `theme` prop (json). The `<ThemeProvider>` is kept at the highest level in the component chain. This allows all of the components within it to inherit the `theme` prop. In case of our Next.js app the `<ThemeProvider>` is added in `src/pages/_app.js`.

## How to use
1. Create a theme using [Theme Manager](http://theme-manager.com). Download the theme and store it as `src/themes/theme.js`.
2. Now in all `styled-component`, theme prop is available to use as following:
```jsx
export const Button = styled.button`
    color: ${props => props.theme.colors.white[0]};
    font-size: 1em;
    margin: 1em;
    padding: 0.25em 1em;
    border: 2px solid ${props => props.theme.colors.black[0]};
    background-color: ${props => props.theme.colors.black[0]};
    border-radius: 3px;
    display: block;
`;
```
