# Universal React App Generator

### Installation

```cmd
npm install
```

```cmd
npm link
```
This will install the module globally on your system. You can then simply type the name of the application from shell/command-prompt from any working directory and the app will execute.

### Running

To create a new app, run the command
```cmd
universal-react-v2
```

Once this command is executed a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project will be created.

This project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

#### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
