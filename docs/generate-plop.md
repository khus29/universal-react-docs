# Generate Plop

Generate-plop is a simple, scalable and fast component generator. It can help 
you to scaffold components, templates, hooks and pages simply by running few 
cli commands. Automating the component creation process makes really easy for 
the team to maintain consistency and saves good time. 

This tool will generate typescript files by default. However, we can generate
javascript files as well by passing --js in script command.
