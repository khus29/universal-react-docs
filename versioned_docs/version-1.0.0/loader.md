## Loader
Loader is a react component, mainly used to load the other micro react micro apps using maifest files, solve the problems of cross-team collaboration and reduce the build dependecy .

# Goals
To compose multiple independently delivered front-end applications into a whole, and to decompose front-end applications into some smaller and simpler applications that can be "independently developed", "independently tested" and "independently deployed", while still appearing to users as cohesive individual products.
